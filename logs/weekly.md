# 🗓️ StudentOS - Week 1 Log (July 2025)
## 🎯 Goal:
Kickstart the StudentOS project — a personal AI-powered learning assistant to help students manage their time, focus better, and learn faster.

## ✅ What I Did:
- Created first GitHub repo and set up project structure (`main.py`)
- Learned how GitHub Pages work for hosting a frontend
- Started designing homepage UI with help from ChatGPT
- Uploaded first screenshot + learned basic image linking
- Struggled with root folders and file placement — but figured it out

## 📚 What I Learned:
- Basics of GitHub project layout and file organization
- How front-end (HTML/CSS) and back-end (Python) can interact
- How version control helps me not mess things up
- That learning by building > watching tutorials



# 🗓️ StudentOS - Week 2 Log (July 2025)

📅 Daily Breakdown:

📌 Day 1 
Attended lecture on Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Learned about K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees
Practical exercise: Applied KNN to a mock dataset using Python and scikit-learn
Realized how tuning k impacts model accuracy


📌 Day 2
Covered basics of Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
Explored techniques like handling missing values, one-hot encoding, and normalization
Started preprocessing a real-world dataset (Titanic dataset or similar)


📌 Day 3
Learned Model Evaluation Techniques: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Hands-on activity: Calculated confusion matrix and metrics from scratch
Began comparing Logistic Regression and KNN performance


📌 Day 4 
Deep dive into Linear Regression for prediction problems
Practiced building regression models using real housing dataset
Explored matplotlib for data visualization and plotting residuals



📌 Day 5 
Workshop on Python Libraries for Data Science (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Did exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation heatmaps
Got introduced to overfitting and bias-variance tradeoff



📌 Day 6 
Guest lecture or recorded session: Intro to Neural Networks
Explored a beginner-level ANN with Keras
Noted how layers, activation functions, and optimizers work


📌 Day 7
Revision of Week 2 content
Started preparing for Week 3 quiz (topics: KNN, Regression, EDA)
Uploaded cleaned dataset and results to personal GitHub repo



📝 Key Learnings:
Understood how to differentiate between classification and regression tasks.
Gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
Learned to use key tools like Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
Discovered the importance of visualizations in understanding model performance.



💡 Reflections:
Found KNN surprisingly intuitive, but model tuning is tricky with small datasets.
Realized that proper data cleaning significantly boosts model accuracy.
Excited about neural networks — eager to explore deeper in upcoming weeks.
Need to revise core metrics (precision/recall) for the quiz next week.






# 🗓️ StudentOS - Week 3 Log (July- August)


Focus areas this week:
Internship onboarding and initial tasks
Academic commitments + exam management
Slow but steady progress toward project goals
🔧 Internship Progress
✅ Officially started 2 new internships:



IIT-Madras Internship → received introductory assignments on AI/Data Science.


Building-U High School Internship → attended orientation call, given first content-research brief.


Created separate folders on GitHub to document internship reflections & outputs.



 📘 Academic Update
Sat for Spanish, English, and Physics IB exams — ✅ completed.


Balancing EE and project with study time this week → lower dev output but continued maintaining GitHub consistency.


 
 📌 Goals for Week 4
Begin code-based graphical logging of internship tasks
Upload screenshots + finish documentation for vector portion
Add first internship reflection entry to logs/ repo




# 🗓️ StudentOS - Week 4 Log (July- August)


This week was a busy blend of academics, leadership, and ongoing projects:




📘Academics: Completed my Unit Tests for Spanish, English, and Physics, Business Management, computer science,  balancing preparation alongside project commitments.




📌IITM Internship: Continued with assigned tasks and research modules, progressing through core assignments and Datasets.


📌U-Build Internship: Waiting to vist the fullstack developer team.



📌Leadership Duties: Attended the Prefectorial meeting as Deputy Head Boy (Pastoral Care) , trying contributing to planning and school initiatives.


📌NGO Development: Worked on building the EVEREST NGO website UI/UX design and structure (wix) , ensuring it aligns with our mission and vision.



📌Extra-Curricular: Maintained involvement in school activities while managing academic and project timelines effectively.
