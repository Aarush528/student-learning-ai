# 🗓️ StudentOS - Week 1 Log (July 2025)
## 🎯 Goal:
Kickstart the StudentOS project — a personal AI-powered learning assistant to help students manage their time, focus better, and learn faster.

## ✅ What I Did:
- Created first GitHub repo and set up project structure (`main.py`)
- Learned how GitHub Pages work for hosting a frontend
- Started designing homepage UI with help from ChatGPT
- Uploaded first screenshot + learned basic image linking
- Struggled with root folders and file placement — but figured it out

## 📚 What I Learned:
- Basics of GitHub project layout and file organization
- How front-end (HTML/CSS) and back-end (Python) can interact
- How version control helps me not mess things up
- That learning by building > watching tutorials
