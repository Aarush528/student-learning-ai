# 🗓️ StudentOS - Week 1 Log (July 2025)
## 🎯 Goal:
Kickstart the StudentOS project — a personal AI-powered learning assistant to help students manage their time, focus better, and learn faster.

## ✅ What I Did:
- Created first GitHub repo and set up project structure (`main.py`)
- Learned how GitHub Pages work for hosting a frontend
- Started designing homepage UI with help from ChatGPT
- Uploaded first screenshot + learned basic image linking
- Struggled with root folders and file placement — but figured it out

## 📚 What I Learned:
- Basics of GitHub project layout and file organization
- How front-end (HTML/CSS) and back-end (Python) can interact
- How version control helps me not mess things up
- That learning by building > watching tutorials

🧠 Internship Weekly Log – Week 2 (July 15 – July 21, 2025)
Name: Aarush Jha
Internship Title: Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Internship
Institution: IIT Madras (or RIT – you can edit)



Week: 2
Duration: July 15 to July 21, 2025

📅 Daily Breakdown:
📌 Day 1 – July 15
Attended lecture on Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Learned about K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees
Practical exercise: Applied KNN to a mock dataset using Python and scikit-learn
Realized how tuning k impacts model accuracy
📌 Day 2 – July 16
Covered basics of Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
Explored techniques like handling missing values, one-hot encoding, and normalization
Started preprocessing a real-world dataset (Titanic dataset or similar)
📌 Day 3 – July 17
Learned Model Evaluation Techniques: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Hands-on activity: Calculated confusion matrix and metrics from scratch
Began comparing Logistic Regression and KNN performance
📌 Day 4 – July 18
Deep dive into Linear Regression for prediction problems
Practiced building regression models using real housing dataset
Explored matplotlib for data visualization and plotting residuals
📌 Day 5 – July 19
Workshop on Python Libraries for Data Science (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Did exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation heatmaps
Got introduced to overfitting and bias-variance tradeoff
📌 Day 6 – July 20
Guest lecture or recorded session: Intro to Neural Networks
Explored a beginner-level ANN with Keras
Noted how layers, activation functions, and optimizers work
📌 Day 7 – July 21
Revision of Week 2 content
Started preparing for Week 3 quiz (topics: KNN, Regression, EDA)
Uploaded cleaned dataset and results to personal GitHub repo

📝 Key Learnings:
Understood how to differentiate between classification and regression tasks.
Gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
Learned to use key tools like Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
Discovered the importance of visualizations in understanding model performance.

💡 Reflections:
Found KNN surprisingly intuitive, but model tuning is tricky with small datasets.
Realized that proper data cleaning significantly boosts model accuracy.
Excited about neural networks — eager to explore deeper in upcoming weeks.
Need to revise core metrics (precision/recall) for the quiz next week.
